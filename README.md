## Abstract

Splice site strength is a critical determinant in the accurate recognition and processing of pre-mRNA during splicing, a process that plays a pivotal role in gene expression regulation. This project aims to develop a novel method for quantifying splice site strength across various vertebrate species by systematically analysing splice site sequences. By leveraging advanced computational approaches, we will identify and compare sequence patterns of both donor (5') and acceptor (3') splice sites, focusing on conserved motifs and species-specific variations. Using a combination of position weight matrices (PWM) and maximum entropy models (MaxEntScan), we will create a scoring framework that accurately predicts splice site strength. Our approach will integrate both nucleotide composition and sequence context, accounting for evolutionary divergence among vertebrates. The resulting scoring method will provide valuable insights into splicing mechanisms, potential regulatory elements, and the evolutionary conservation of splicing signals. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a deeper understanding of splicing regulation in vertebrates and pave the way for more accurate predictions of splicing outcomes in genomic studies.
